# GitHub Profile Finder

This project is a simple and modern **GitHub Profile Finder** built with **React (Vite)** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. It connects to the **GitHub API** to fetch real-time profile details such as username, bio, repositories, followers, and more.

The main goal of this project is to practice working with APIs, improve React development skills, and build a clean and responsive UI.
